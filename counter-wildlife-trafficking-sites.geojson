The helpline is developed for officers who require assistance with identification of seized wildlife/wildlife products, handling of live wildlife, legal and procedural guidance and other related queries. Since the set-up of the Helpline in 2019, we have provided assistance on 223 queries to officers, 81 of which have been related to wildlife crime cases.\n路         Carrying out and disseminating multidisciplinary research on wildlife crime to refine knowledge in this field\nThe CWT programme's direction and activities are supplemented by a three-pronged research: legal research, wildlife trafficking research, and political economy analysis. We also routinely develop awareness material including: Infographics on species in trade, Policy updates, etc. \n路         Developing technological solutions for smoother functioning of government machinery\nTo provide technological support to the enforcement agencies we have developed the Sugava app to address the challenges faced by field-based forest officers while preparing legal documents in wildlife crime cases. The app helps in species identification and generating preliminary offence report through a simple questionnaire." }, "geometry": { "type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [ [ 93.603152219230168, 27.075085411179593 ], [ 93.007743375403166, 26.958540352118593 ], [ 93.899660079962345, 27.546291204385142 ], [ 90.99835818360512, 26.650545504045681 ], [ 92.785302651794979, 24.829379386069952 ], [ 95.534760934242186, 27.325406010312648 ], [ 95.388780470120608, 27.2650993267739 ], [ 93.018153457680711, 25.164416516840774 ], [ 91.726824630795434, 26.137938693966309 ], [ 91.863950542175218, 26.191544634889638 ], [ 93.438026776207124, 25.83556768344571 ], [ 94.635545206476323, 26.987138164352057 ], [ 92.80719972141307, 26.64922928674612 ], [ 73.846012617678397, 15.485792089464512 ], [ 73.302295216884772, 23.492222265940537 ], [ 85.436263188338387, 23.34938277491997 ], [ 76.927097831528926, 15.145968713968454 ], [ 75.747527818979592, 12.430732081307729 ], [ 74.168067059631724, 14.854486410197888 ], [ 76.959404983424662, 8.513669398125053 ], [ 77.444730198569701, 23.234243675247022 ], [ 77.13458154037049, 21.384838713392448 ], [ 77.754878856768912, 20.899513498247384 ], [ 75.276561338010382, 19.868556384418511 ], [ 79.30905478265386, 19.980083365025294 ], [ 74.777438276743084, 20.881811871271164 ], [ 80.203962890166167, 21.447904966155594 ], [ 72.85947035919861, 19.104559548650421 ], [ 79.09403273836989, 21.162166156055392 ], [ 73.788480460378679, 20.000544561225922 ], [ 73.857402384422926, 18.478518738581627 ], [ 74.236472966666412, 16.68942046026579 ], [ 72.995160397160788, 19.156250991683617 ], [ 78.126971991623719, 20.38823038397495 ], [ 94.040897300718669, 23.959606541860435 ], [ 93.949360370347705, 24.800130943678575 ], [ 94.301149357655746, 24.244447931073626 ], [ 91.886728205988518, 25.579092272717801 ], [ 91.871292566749489, 26.0504177220397 ], [ 90.203525592225844, 25.505503760066642 ], [ 92.729226933755839, 23.743687076691277 ], [ 93.745825313405192, 25.920471177748372 ], [ 94.513299655103751, 26.318208114419086 ], [ 95.07746329508133, 26.89747086080342 ], [ 93.754934135398031, 25.511314560303425 ], [ 94.814070265043298, 26.229610237449748 ], [ 94.256502668577767, 26.097150914677655 ], [ 73.970572767041986, 25.689273121995246 ], [ 70.905970183475119, 26.912368047510878 ], [ 73.584771528154945, 25.151359042932917 ], [ 76.968945689222821, 11.018326219921063 ], [ 78.549842321982638, 19.63356672542406 ], [ 78.483074208064977, 17.382835143361397 ], [ 79.283214670013578, 19.372955700132582 ], [ 79.479749844045358, 19.356263671653171 ], [ 80.002048799691551, 17.596600798404193 ], [ 78.688224622602334, 16.220854580181687 ], [ 78.999988638395223, 19.116113842562282 ], [ 80.004202609817867, 17.953864053116774 ], [ 91.283706241647636, 23.831881114262 ], [ 89.30004711525558, 26.62591130070296 ], [ 88.281833378011456, 26.877368632957328 ], [ 87.920531729311904, 22.285983896055829 ], [ 88.263458685370807, 22.596065247687488 ], [ 88.71797992860256, 26.52333609343432 ], [ 88.48052236216968, 22.720784315317943 ], [ 88.931849347935298, 22.842485805219258 ], [ 88.431896172350392, 22.975618193655858 ], [ 88.487257566797098, 23.405114171406751 ], [ 87.231720724755704, 22.346031368078172 ], [ 87.861869786746723, 23.239146479153099 ], [ 86.362654738110749, 23.329325007817587 ] ] } }
